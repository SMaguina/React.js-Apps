# React.js-Apps
Apps and script examples worked on with the React.js library

These are apps and script examples worked on when learning React.js. I attended a full-day workshop by Pluralsight course creator, [Samer](https://www.pluralsight.com/authors/samer-buna), in ReactJS and GraphQL. The following external boilerplates and templates were used:

* RGR.js Express Webpack Template - https://github.com/RGRjs/express-webpack-template

It was quite a great experience going through the workshop and learning the basics of React, how it interacts with Node, and the benefits of GraphQL (in short, it is JSON without the values). I will update this repository as I continue to delve into more projects involving React.js.
